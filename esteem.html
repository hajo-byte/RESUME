        his household,<br>
        his companions and those that folloow him ameen.
        Alhamdulillah,<br> within a space of few years , what began as a mere dream has metamorphosed into<br> 
        an incredible reality.<br>
        It was a huge risk, jumping off <br>the clif and building your wings on the way down.
        In the board room our heads were saying<br> no and our hearts were saying yes.
        Finally, <br>the entire board of Diretors unanimously went with the<br> hearts and said yes.
        What followed later was a combination of <br>capacity and tenacity.
        Esteem learning learning center,<br> Abuja opened its doors in september,2015 to receive its 
        pioneer students <br>into JSS1 and completed that inugural session with 38 JSS1 boys<br> graduating to JSS2
        and insha Allah,<br> our school is piosed to offer admissions to about 300 boys<br> by the time we hit SSS3.<br>
        We thank the Almighty  Allah for that rare privilege.
